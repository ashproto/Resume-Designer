# CloudKit sync — design

**Status:** approved, not yet planned or built
**Date:** 2026-08-11

## Goal

Keep a person's résumés, job descriptions, applications, chat threads and
version history in sync across their Apple devices, through their own iCloud
account, without moving any of it onto a server we run.

## Scope

**In:** iOS and iPadOS, built against the SwiftUI shell that already exists.

**Designed for but not built:** macOS. The record model, the conflict rules and
the storage hook are deliberately platform-neutral, so a Mac client
reimplements only the transport.

**Out:** Windows. CloudKit cannot serve it. If Windows sync is ever wanted it
needs a different mechanism (CloudKit Web Services, or a backend), and that is
a separate design.

**Out:** the OpenRouter API key. It lives in the OS keychain, not in
`appStorage`, and secrets should not ride in CloudKit records. iCloud Keychain
is the right mechanism for it and is a separate decision.

### The macOS question, recorded

Three candidates, none blocking this design:

1. **Tauri plus a Swift CloudKit helper.** A Tauri `.app` is a normal signed
   bundle and can carry iCloud entitlements; the project already calls
   Objective-C from Rust for PDF export. Least disruption, keeps the desktop
   React chrome.
2. **Mac Catalyst**, making the iOS app the Mac app and leaving Tauri for
   Windows only. One shared Swift client, but it moves the *backend* as well as
   the chrome: Catalyst is `aarch64-apple-ios-macabi`, which Tauri's tooling
   does not target, and whether wry/tao build under it is unverified. It would
   also put an iPad-shaped UI in front of Mac users — there is not even an iPad
   layout yet — against a standing decision that the desktop keeps its React
   chrome.
3. **A native SwiftUI macOS target.** Apple has steered multiplatform this way
   rather than Catalyst; worth evaluating against (2) if a shared client is the
   goal.

Deciding this needs a spike, not a guess. It changes who writes the transport,
never the model below.

## Decisions

| Question | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| Platform scope | Apple only; iOS/iPadOS first, Mac deferred behind a neutral design |
| Record granularity | One record per résumé, plus one per other syncable unit |
| Conflict resolution | Newer wins; the losing version is written to that résumé's version history |
| Multi-profile | One CloudKit record zone per profile |
| Database | Private, in the user's own iCloud account |

## What syncs

### Synced

Content, and anything that changes what a résumé looks like.

- **Each résumé**, one record each, decomposed out of the `variants` map inside
  `resume-designer-data`
- **`settings` and `userProfile`**, split out of that same blob into their own
  records
- `resume-designer-job-descriptions`
- `resume-designer-applications`
- `resume-designer-chat-threads` (and the legacy `resume-designer-chat-history`)
- `resume-designer-learned-answers`
- **Version history** — every `resume-designer-history-variant-*` key. Load-
  bearing: it is the recovery path for the conflict rule, and a losing edit
  parked in history on one device is no use from another.
- **Token usage**, by a merge rule rather than newer-wins — see below
- Design defaults: `resume-header-style`, `resume-accent-settings`,
  `resume-font-settings`, `resume-spacing-settings`, `resume-photo-settings`
- `resume-designer-onboarding-complete`, so a second device does not re-run the
  wizard on an account that already has résumés
- `resume-edit-hint-dismissed`
- The profile registry, `resume-designer-profiles`

### Device-local — never leaves the machine

- **`currentVariantId`** (inside the data blob). Which résumé is open is a
  property of a device; syncing it makes one device change documents because
  another did.
- **`resume-zoom`.** A zoom that suits a phone is wrong on a Mac.
- **`resume-designer-active-profile`**, for the same reason as
  `currentVariantId`.
- **`resume-designer-theme`.** Commonly set to follow the system appearance,
  and a synced value fights that on a device whose system setting differs.
- **`resume-designer-update-channel`, `resume-designer-auto-update-check`.** A
  beta Mac beside a stable phone is a legitimate setup.
- **`resume-designer-bridge-token`.** The loopback companion bridge is
  machine-specific.
- **`resume-designer-model-catalog`.** A regenerable cache.
- **`resume-designer-electron-migration-attempted`.** A historical fact about
  one machine.

### Not pruned, and it matters

`tokenTrackingService.js` never trims `events`, and no history retention policy
exists. Locally that is harmless. Synced, both grow without bound against a
record size limit. See "Record size" below for how that is handled, and
"Deferred" for what is not being solved now.

## Architecture

### The seam

`appStorage` is a single coalescing writer over a committed in-memory cache,
with `loadAll` / `write` / `delete` / `clear` beneath it. Every platform goes
through it. Sync hooks there and nowhere else.

### The split, and why it is where it is

**Swift must not learn the document's schema.** That invariant holds across
every screen of the iOS port: the native side echoes back paths it was handed
and never parses a résumé. Splitting `resume-designer-data` into per-résumé
records is schema knowledge, so it cannot live in Swift.

**JS owns what a unit is.** A new framework-free module:

- enumerates the syncable units and classifies every storage key
- splits the data blob into per-résumé units on the way out, and reassembles it
  on the way in
- merges token usage
- knows where a losing version goes in version history

**Swift owns transport.** Zones, subscriptions, change tokens, conflict
detection, retry and backoff. A record is:

```
{ unitId: String, kind: String, payload: <opaque>, modifiedAt: Date }
```

`payload` is an opaque JSON string Swift never parses. `kind` describes its
shape on the record.

**Amended 2026-08-13.** `kind` was written down here as the thing that lets
"the transport route a conflict to the right resolution without understanding
the contents", and that was never achievable: whether a unit takes newer-wins
or a *union* is a property of what the app does with it, not of a three-way
label — and the implementation duly never branched on `kind` anywhere. So
conflict resolution is the model's, top to bottom (below), and `kind` routes
nothing.

This is the same division every other screen uses, and it is what makes the Mac
client a transport-only job.

### Zones

One record zone per profile, named from the profile id. The profile registry
syncs so that zones and local profiles can be reconciled. A per-profile zone
buys atomic per-profile fetches and a clean per-profile delete.

## Conflict resolution

CloudKit rejects a save whose record changed underneath it and attaches the
server's copy. On that rejection:

1. **Both versions cross to JS** — the payload this device tried to send and the
   server's — with the server record's change tag held on the transport side.
2. JS resolves. A snapshot compares `modifiedAt`: the newer payload wins and is
   written locally, and the losing payload goes into that résumé's version
   history. An append-shaped unit takes its **union** instead (below), and a
   union has no loser to park.
3. JS answers which units it resolved *durably* and which of them still owe the
   server a save. The transport keeps the server's change tag only for those,
   and re-queues the save; what goes up is read from the model at send time, so
   it is the resolution or a later edit built on it.
4. One non-blocking notice per resolution — not per record — raised on the
   number of versions that actually reached version history.

Nothing is destroyed, recovery is a restore the app already supports, and the
user is never asked to make a decision mid-edit.

**Amended 2026-08-13.** Steps 1–3 replace "the transport compares `modifiedAt`
and hands JS the loser", which was the design until an adversarial review found
what it cost: the transport applied newer-wins to *every* kind, so a save
conflict on the token log or a version history never reached the union below —
the loser was handed to the parking path, which has nowhere to put a unit that
is not a résumé, and CloudKit was left holding one side. Conflict resolution is
model-side for the same reason the split above puts everything else there: only
the side that knows what a unit is can tell a comparison from a union.

### The two units that merge instead

**Token usage.** Every event carries a unique `id`, and `summary` is derived
from `events`. The merge is a union of events by id followed by a recomputed
summary — correct rather than lossy, and nearly free.

**Version history** (amended 2026-08-12, after implementation proved the
original rule self-defeating). History is append-shaped too, so newer-wins
loses entries — and because a conflict's loser is *parked in history*, the
lossy rule destroyed the thing it was meant to protect the moment it synced.
Exercised: a remote history unit lands, one local edit rewrites the key from
the store's in-memory array, and the parked loser is gone. History therefore
takes the same union treatment: union both sides' entries, order by timestamp,
cap at the store's `MAX_HISTORY`.

Entries have no unique id — they are `{data, timestamp, description,
changeType}` — so identity is a canonical hash of the entry, using the same
key-sorted serialisation the token-usage tie-break already relies on. Two
devices must compute the same identity for the same entry, which insertion-order
-dependent `JSON.stringify` would not guarantee.

### Undo traverses only this user's own steps

Unioning two histories has a consequence worth stating outright: a merged
timeline contains states this user was never in. Edit on the phone, open the
Mac, press Cmd+Z, and undo would reach the phone's document rather than your
own last state. Nothing is lost, but it reads as loss.

So the undo timeline is **a record of steps taken on this device**, and
`undo`/`redo` skip entries that are not — both parked conflict losers and
entries whose origin is another device. Version history's dialog still shows
the whole merged union and can restore anything in it; only the traversal is
narrowed. This is one principle, not two: the rule that already excludes a
parked loser excludes a foreign entry for the same reason.

Entries therefore carry an `origin` — a device identifier held in the
device-local sync-state key, never synced. An entry with no `origin` predates
this field and is treated as local, which is correct: history was device-local
before sync existed, so every such entry was in fact written here.

**The general rule, stated once so the next append-shaped unit does not repeat
this:** a unit whose payload GROWS by accumulation cannot take newer-wins. Ask
of every synced unit whether it is a snapshot or a log. Snapshots take
newer-wins; logs need a merge.

## Record size

CloudKit caps a record's fields at roughly 1MB. Version history and the token
log are the two units that will exceed it.

The transport handles this **without learning what it carries**: a payload of
more than **700KB encoded** is stored as a `CKAsset` instead of a string field,
chosen purely on byte count. The headroom below 1MB covers the record's other
fields and encoding overhead, so the decision never has to be revisited at the
boundary.

## Error handling

- **Offline is the normal case, not the error case.** A local write always wins
  locally and lands immediately. Sync is background reconciliation; nothing in
  the app blocks on the network.
- **First sync on a fresh device** is the dangerous moment. An empty local store
  meeting a populated cloud must never be read as "everything was deleted".
  Deletions are explicit tombstones and are never inferred from absence.
- **Signed out of iCloud, or a different account.** Sync stops and says so. It
  must not wipe or overwrite local data.
- **Quota exceeded.** Surfaced the way the storage-full toast already is, and
  the app keeps working locally.
- **Partial failures.** CloudKit reports per-record outcomes for a batch; a
  failed record is retried with backoff and does not fail its neighbours.

## Testing

The parts most likely to be wrong are pure functions over data and are tested
as such, alongside the existing projections:

- key classification — every key in `BACKUP_FIXED_KEYS` and the history prefix
  is either synced or explicitly device-local, with no key falling through
  unclassified
- blob split and reassembly — round-tripping `resume-designer-data` through
  decomposition is byte-identical, and reassembly preserves keys the splitter
  did not know about
- token-usage merge — union by id is order-independent, idempotent, and the
  recomputed summary matches a fresh computation over the merged events
- conflict resolution — a snapshot's newer payload wins and the loser reaches
  history, while an append-shaped unit unions on the save-conflict path exactly
  as it does on the fetch path: asserted on the disk AND on what would be sent
  back, since holding the union only locally is how the entries were lost

Transport is deliberately thin and is verified on device, including: a real
two-device edit of the same résumé, a first sync onto a fresh install, and
airplane-mode edits reconciling on reconnect.

## Deferred

- **Retention.** Neither version history nor the token log is pruned. Syncing
  makes that a growth problem rather than a disk problem, but capping either
  one changes user-visible behaviour and deserves its own decision.
- **Sharing.** Private database only. No collaboration, no shared zones.
- **Windows.**
- **A Mac client**, pending the spike described above.
