## Task 3 — project generation

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Did `tauri ios init` succeed? | **Yes**, cleanly. |
| Does tauri#11257 (productName vs Cargo name) reproduce? | **No.** `productName: "On Paper"` and Cargo `name = "resume-designer"` coexist fine in the generated `project.yml`/pbxproj. The plan's pessimism was unwarranted; no `PRODUCT_NAME` workaround is needed. |
| `TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY` | **`"1,2"`** — universal iPhone + iPad by default. Already matches the full-parity decision; no change required. |
| `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` | **`17.4`** in both Debug and Release. The `tauri.ios.conf.json` overlay IS being read. |
| Was `UIApplicationSceneManifest` merged? | **Yes — but not at `init`.** See below. |
| Did anything under `gen/` become tracked? | **No.** `git status --short` empty. The regeneration-safety design holds. |
| iOS icons | `icons/ios/` exists, 18 tracked files, `AppIcon-512@2x.png` is a real 1024×1024. **`hasAlpha: yes`** — an App Store upload gate, deferred to Phase 5. |

### The `Info.ios.plist` merge fires at build, not at init

The Task 3 implementer checked immediately after `tauri ios init`, found no scene
manifest, and concluded *"there is no automatic filename pickup of
`Info.ios.plist`."* **That conclusion was wrong.** The merge happens during
`ios dev` / `ios build`, exactly as the Task 2 reviewer hypothesised.

Verified twice, at both ends of the pipeline:

`src-tauri/gen/apple/resume-designer_iOS/Info.plist` (generated) —

```
"CFBundleDisplayName" => "On Paper"
"ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption" => false
"UIApplicationSceneManifest" => {
  "UIApplicationSupportsMultipleScenes" => false
  "UISceneConfigurations" => {
    "UIWindowSceneSessionRoleApplication" => [
      0 => { "UISceneConfigurationName" => "Default Configuration"
             "UISceneDelegateClassName" => "TaoSceneDelegate" } ] } }
```

`Build/Products/debug-iphonesimulator/On Paper.app/Info.plist` (processed,
binary) — same manifest, plus `CFBundleIdentifier => com.resumedesigner.app`,
`MinimumOSVersion => 17.4`, `UIDeviceFamily => [1, 2]`.

**Action: none. Do NOT add `bundle.iOS.infoPlist`** — the auto-detection works.

**Caveat on interpreting a successful launch:** tao wires the scene delegate
*programmatically* at runtime (`tao-0.35.3/src/platform_impl/ios/view.rs:628-646`
returns a `UISceneConfiguration` named `"TaoScene"` and calls
`setDelegateClass`). The static Info.plist entry mainly satisfies the
manifest-*presence* requirement, so a typo in `UISceneDelegateClassName` would
not surface as a launch crash. The string is correct here — diffed against
tao's own `#[name = "TaoSceneDelegate"]` at `scene.rs:52` — but do not treat a
green boot as evidence for it.

## Tooling sharp edges discovered (not in the plan)

These cost real time and belong in `TAURI.md` when Phase 1 lands.

### 1. `tauri ios dev` classifies every simulator as a physical device

```
Detected connected device: iPhone 17 (iPhone18,3) with target "aarch64-apple-ios"
Detected connected device: iPad Pro 13-inch (M5) (iPad17,4) with target "aarch64-apple-ios"
```

Neither is a real device — the only physical iPhone paired to this Mac is an
iPhone 16 Pro (`iPhone17,1`). Tauri 2.11.2 assigns the **device** Rust target
(`aarch64-apple-ios`), builds with `-sdk iphoneos`, and rewrites `devUrl` to the
LAN address, then tries to install that device binary onto a simulator:

> The executable has code for these platforms and architectures: `[iOS, arm64]`.
> This device can run code for these platforms: `iOS-simulator`.

It is systematic, not a name-ambiguity artifact — it reproduced with an
unambiguous iPad simulator name. Both slices are built and present on disk
(`target/aarch64-apple-ios{,-sim}/debug/libon_paper_lib.a`); the wrong one is
selected.

### 2. `xcodebuild` cannot be driven standalone for a Tauri dev build

The Xcode "Build Rust Code" phase shells out to `tauri ios xcode-script`, which
opens a **WebSocket back to a running `tauri ios dev` supervisor** to read its
options. Without that parent process it panics:

```
failed to read CLI options: Context("failed to build WebSocket client",
  Io(Os { code: 61, kind: ConnectionRefused }))
  at crates/tauri-cli/src/mobile/mod.rs:403
```

So "just run xcodebuild with `-sdk iphonesimulator`" is not available as a
workaround for finding 1.

### 3. The way through: `tauri ios build --debug --target aarch64-sim`

`tauri ios build` accepts `--target [aarch64 | aarch64-sim | x86_64]` and acts
as its own supervisor. It produces a self-contained bundle (assets from
`frontendDist`, no dev server), which is also a *better* probe host than
`ios dev` — it exercises the real `tauri://` custom-scheme asset pipeline, which
is what the Task 5 PDF spike depends on.

### 4. Signing is required even for a simulator run

`tauri ios dev` performs an xcodebuild **archive**, which demands a development
team regardless of simulator vs device:

> `error: Signing for "resume-designer_iOS" requires a development team.`

Supplied via `APPLE_DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=847VH25R7U` in the environment, keeping the
team ID out of git as Task 2's config intended.

### 5. CocoaPods must be installed and needs UTF-8

`brew install cocoapods` (1.17.0). It warns that it requires a UTF-8 locale;
prefix invocations with `LANG=en_US.UTF-8`.

## MILESTONE: On Paper launches on iOS

**On Paper builds, installs, and runs on an iOS 27.0 simulator.** The working
route is *not* the one the plan assumed:

```bash
npx tauri ios build --debug --target aarch64-sim     # NOT `tauri ios dev`
xcrun simctl install <udid> src-tauri/gen/apple/build/arm64-sim/On\ Paper.app
xcrun simctl launch  <udid> com.resumedesigner.app
```

Binary verified `platform IOSSIMULATOR, minos 17.4, arm64`. It launches on the
iOS 27 SDK with no scene-lifecycle crash, and every asset loads through the
`tauri://` custom-scheme handler with **zero CSP violations and zero errors**.

## RESOLVED: the blank screen — three-part failure, now fixed

**On Paper renders correctly on iOS 27.** Onboarding, typography, palette, all
of it. Getting there required fixing three separate things, and the first two
diagnoses I published were wrong — recorded here because the wrong turns are
themselves the finding.

### What it was NOT

- **Not `glass.css`.** Gating `data-tauri` on platform (commit `66fa6a9`) is a
  correct, independently-required D1 fix and it is kept — but the screen stayed
  black afterwards. The probe later proved `data-tauri` was `null` and
  `body` background was an opaque `rgb(232,228,223)` the whole time.
- **Not the blob `<a download>`** tearing down the document.
- **Not CSP, not asset loading, not a JS error.** Storage proved the app was
  fully alive: it created a profile, ran the migration probe, and fetched an
  81 KB model catalog from OpenRouter over the network.

### What it was

Read out through the app's own storage layer (probe writes a key; the file is
read from the simulator container — no Safari Web Inspector needed):

```
innerSize [0,0]   outerSize [0,0]   docScroll [0,0]   centerElement null
screen [402,874]  rootHtmlLength 29343  bodyHtmlLength 29767
bodyStyle.background rgb(232,228,223)   resumeRect 816x1056
```

**The app was rendering perfectly into a 0×0 viewport.** Nothing was hidden;
there was nothing to paint into. That also explains why a probe overlay with
`position:fixed; inset:0` never appeared — it resolves against the viewport, so
a 0×0 viewport yields a 0×0 overlay.

Rust-side instrumentation (written to `<container>/Documents/ios-dbg.txt`) found
three stacked causes:

| # | Cause | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **WKWebView frame is 0×0.** wry's iOS branch does `initWithFrame: ns_view.frame()` (`wkwebview/mod.rs:447-451`) — the parent's frame *at creation time* — and sets **no autoresizing mask**. Every `setAutoresizingMask` in wry (`:504/507/521/677`) is macOS-only; the iOS path is a bare `addSubview` at `:705`. | `frame_before=0x0` |
| 2 | **The parent view is also 0×0**, while the grandparent is correct. Sizing only the webview leaves it inside a zero-sized ancestor. | `superview_bounds=0x0`, `superview2_bounds=402x874` |
| 3 | **The `UIWindow` has no `windowScene`,** so it is orphaned on iOS 13+: it can be sized, unhidden and fully populated and will still never composite. `makeKeyAndVisible()` was a silent no-op. | `window hidden=false key=false`; after attaching a scene, `key=true` |

**We trigger this ourselves.** Task 2's `UIApplicationSceneManifest` is
*required* (without it the app will not launch on the iOS 27 SDK), and it is the
same change that moves tao onto the scene lifecycle where the window is never
attached. tao's own `set_focus()` reads `window.windowScene()` and branches on
it, so tao knows the association matters — but under a *static* scene manifest
nothing ever assigns it.

### The workaround (spike-quality; needs a proper home in Phase 1)

From Rust via `with_webview`, on a retry loop **after** the event loop starts
(doing it inside `setup()` is too early — attempt 1 failed exactly that way):

1. size the superview to the grandparent/screen bounds + `autoresizingMask`
2. size the webview to match + `autoresizingMask`
3. if `windowScene` is nil, find the connected `UIWindowScene` and attach it
4. `setHidden:false` + `makeKeyAndVisible`

This belongs upstream (tao/wry) rather than in app code. File it; carry the
workaround until it lands.

## ASIDE: an unexplained navigation-policy log — observed pre-fix, needs re-observation

**This was captured during the blank-screen investigation above, before the
0×0-viewport fix landed** (the app was still invisible, rendering into a
0×0 `WKWebView` inside a scene-less `UIWindow`). It is recorded here because
the design spec cites it as a still-open question, and this document is the
declared authority — it should not cite a log line findings.md never wrote
down.

The console log at that point in the investigation included:

```
decidePolicyForNavigationAction … Client responded with policy 2
Adding download 30 to UIProcess DownloadProxyMap
```

Policy `2` is wry's `WKNavigationActionPolicyDownload`. Per wry's
`wkwebview/navigation.rs:70`, wry only returns `Download` when
`has_download_handler == true` — which contradicts the premise, shared by the
audit and by the corrected blob-download finding, that this app leaves
`download_handler` at `None`. Unexplained.

**Do not invest time explaining this, or treat it as evidence for the
`<a download>`-on-iOS question, until it is reproduced on the now-visible
app.** It was observed against a broken render (no content occupying the
webview's frame at all), which is a plausible confound for almost anything
navigation-related; a clean re-run on the fixed app is the prerequisite for
trusting this log line at all.

## Task 4 — platform behaviour — ANSWERED

Measured on the running app (iPhone 17, iOS 27.0, 402×874 pt).

| Question | Spec predicted | **Observed** |
|---|---|---|
| App launches on the iOS 27 SDK | yes | **YES** |
| `platform()` | `"ios"` | **`"ios"`**, `version()` = `27.0.0` |
| `navigator.platform` | unknown | **`"iPhone"`** |
| User agent | unknown | `…(iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 18_7 like Mac OS X)… Mobile/15E148` — note the **frozen `18_7`** even on iOS 27 |
| `Promise.withResolvers` | present ≥17.4 | **present** — the 17.4 floor is correct |
| `ReadableStream[Symbol.asyncIterator]` | **absent** | **PRESENT — spec is WRONG** |
| `env(safe-area-inset-*)` | 0 without `viewport-fit=cover` | **0 both before and after** adding it — needs re-measuring now the viewport is non-zero |
| `visualViewport` | — | **present** |
| Task 3.5 platform gate | — | **works** — `data-tauri` is `null` on iOS |
| `document.documentElement.className` | — | **`"desktop electron"`** — spec D1's unconditional desktop classes, **confirmed** |
| Google Fonts at runtime | CDN fetch | **confirmed** — `css2?family=Cormorant…` and `DM+Sans` in `document.styleSheets` |
| `#resume` vs viewport | 816 px cropped | **confirmed** — `resumeRect` 816×1056 at `x=-207` in a 402 pt viewport |
| Onboarding hard-gate | 2.1 rejection risk | **confirmed visually** — Step 1 of 6 demands an `sk-or-v1-…` key before anything else |

### 🔴 `alert()` / `confirm()` — CRITICAL, and the spec had it exactly backwards

**Isolated test run** (`resume-ios-confirm-test`, a probe that does nothing else):

```json
"confirm_ms": 1,          "confirm_typeof": "object",
"confirm_String": "[object Promise]",   "confirm_ctor": "Promise",
"confirm_isPromise": true,
"confirm_strictTrue": false,  "confirm_strictFalse": false,
"confirm_BOOLEAN_COERCION": true,
"confirm_wouldProceed": "YES — DESTRUCTIVE PATH RUNS",
"backupFlowPattern_destructiveRan": true,
"alert_ms": 1, "alert_blocked": false
```

**`window.confirm()` returns a Promise on iOS. A Promise is always truthy.**

So this, the literal shape at `backupFlow.js:248`:

```js
if (confirm('Your current resumes … will be REPLACED. Continue?')) {
  /* destructive import */
}
```

**always takes the destructive branch**, regardless of what the user taps — the
value being tested is a pending Promise object, never a boolean. The test above
ran that exact pattern and `backupFlowPattern_destructiveRan` came back `true`.

`alert()` likewise returns in ~1 ms and does **not** block, though it *does*
present a real native panel (screenshotted over the onboarding screen). It is
fire-and-forget: any code sequencing on it is broken.

**The spec was wrong in the dangerous direction.** It reasoned that `confirm()`
returning `false` made the Import button merely "look dead", and rated it a
low-severity, fail-safe defect. On iOS it is a **silent data-loss path**: a
destructive whole-store replace runs with no confirmation at all.

**Blast radius — 2 reachable `confirm()` gates.**

> **Correction.** An earlier version of this section listed
> `src/native.js:108` as "the shared confirm facade… every caller is affected."
> **That was wrong.** `native.js:85` `showMessage()` opens with
> `if (isTauri) {` at `:86` and returns at `:95`/`:103` through
> `tauri-plugin-dialog`'s `dialog.message` / `dialog.ask`. Lines 106-111 are the
> **web fallback**, and `isTauri` is `true` on iOS (proved — `platform()`
> returned `"ios"` and the migration probe ran, both of which require IPC).
> `native.js:108` and `:110` are therefore unreachable on iOS.

| Site | Consequence on iOS |
|---|---|
| `src/backupFlow.js:248` | whole-store **REPLACE** proceeds unconfirmed |
| `src/backupFlow.js:336` | legacy-Electron replace/merge, same pattern |

(`components/PdfDialog.jsx:164`'s `confirm()` is a local callback prop, not
`window.confirm` — unaffected. `native.js:108` is dead on iOS, per the
correction above.)

Eleven **reachable** `alert()` sites lose their blocking behaviour — direct
calls, not routed through `showMessage()`: `backupFlow.js:167/201/306/330/467`,
`pdf.js:71/111/376/393/404`, `variantManager.js:251`. `backupFlow.js:167` is the
worst: it is the *only* signal that an import never reached disk.

**Untested and important:** the iOS path through `showMessage()` —
`dialog.ask` / `dialog.message` — was never exercised in Phase 0. The
permissions are correctly in the cross-platform capability
(`capabilities/default.json`: `dialog:allow-ask`, `allow-message`,
`allow-confirm`), but whether the plugin actually **presents and resolves** on
iOS is unknown. If it does, it is the right target for all thirteen sites (the
eleven `alert()` calls above plus the two `confirm()` gates) and needs no React
plumbing. Measure it before designing the fix.

**This raises the priority of the spec's Phase 1 "swap `backupFlow.js`
alert/confirm for `confirmDestructive`" item from cleanup to a
data-loss blocker.** Nothing that calls `window.confirm` may ship on iOS.

## Task 5 — createPDF rect spike — **PASSED. D5 option C is viable.**

Run on iOS 27.0 simulator via `tauri ios build --debug --target aarch64-sim`,
with the `ios_view` workaround active (without it the webview is 0×0 and any
capture is a false negative).

**The binding.** `objc2-web-kit` declares `WKWebView` with an AppKit superclass
under `#[cfg(target_os = "macos")]` and ships no UIKit variant, so the typed
`createPDFWithConfiguration_completionHandler` used by `pdf_macos.rs:125` is
unavailable. Dynamic dispatch works and compiles clean:

```rust
let obj = webview.inner() as *mut AnyObject;
let _: () = objc2::msg_send![obj, createPDFWithConfiguration: &*configuration,
                                  completionHandler: &*handler];
```

`WKPDFConfiguration` is **not** cfg-gated and is used as-is, so the iOS Cargo
block needs `objc2-web-kit` **without** the `objc2-app-kit` feature.

**Results — every load-bearing assumption confirmed:**

| Question | Result |
|---|---|
| Does `createPDF` run on iOS? | **Yes** — 63,168 bytes returned |
| Is the `rect` honoured? | **Yes** — a one-sheet rect produced exactly **one** page (`/Type /Page` ×1, `/Count 1`) |
| MediaBox vs requested CSS px | **`MediaBox [0 0 816 1056]`** — byte-exact match to the requested 816×1056. **pt == CSS px 1:1, so `PX_TO_PT = 72/96` in `pdf_merge.rs` stands unchanged.** |
| Vector or raster? | **Vector.** Embedded subset fonts `AAAAAB+Geist-Medium`, `AAAAAC+Geist-SemiBold`, `AAAAAD+Geist-Regular`, 212 text-showing operators. **The ATS requirement is met on iOS.** |
| Does an iframe get its own 816 px layout viewport on a 402 pt device? | **Yes** — `iframe_innerWidth: 816`, `scrollHeight: 2112`, `sameOrigin: true`, body 31,821 bytes. **Option C's core premise is confirmed.** |
| Is `/print.html` served by the `tauri://` scheme handler? | **Yes** — HTTP 200, 31,384 bytes, content verified |

**One caveat, and it is a test artefact rather than a result.** The captured page
contains the *onboarding modal* ("Step 1 of 6 / Welcome to On Paper"), not the
iframe's résumé content. Two reasons, both fixable: the iframe was mounted at
`opacity: 0.01` (borrowed from the native-offscreen-webview technique, where it
keeps a webview rendering — but inside a *captured* document it simply makes the
content invisible), and a full-screen fixed modal was painted over it. So the
PDF **machinery** is proven end-to-end; what is not yet proven is that iframe
content composites into the rect. Re-test with an opaque iframe and no modal
before committing to option C over option A.

**Also guard:** WebKit caps a PDF page at 14400 pt and loops, so a rect taller
than 14400 CSS px silently becomes multiple pages. Untested; reachable in
`.is-overflowing` mode.

## Task 4 addendum — measurements taken with a real viewport

Everything geometric measured before the `ios_view` fix was taken against a 0×0
viewport and is void. Re-measured:

| Question | iPhone 17 (402×874) | iPad Pro 13" (1032×1376) |
|---|---|---|
| `innerSize` | `[402, 778]` | `[1032, 1324]` |
| `env(safe-area-inset-*)` **without** `viewport-fit=cover` | `0px` all round | `0px` all round |
| **with** `viewport-fit=cover` | **`62px` top, `34px` bottom** | **`32px` top, `20px` bottom` |
| `/print.html` reachable | 200, 31,384 B | 200, 31,384 B |

So `viewport-fit=cover` is required and sufficient; the earlier all-zero reading
was an artefact of the 0×0 viewport, not a platform limitation.

### 🔴 iPadOS reports a DESKTOP user agent — the shipped gate missed it

`66fa6a9` gated the glass treatment on `/iPad|iPhone|iPod/.test(userAgent)`,
measured on iPhone only. On iPad:

```
userAgent:         "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/605.1.15…"
navigator.platform: "MacIntel"        maxTouchPoints: 5
gateRegexMatches:   false             dataTauriAttr: "true"   <-- glass RE-ENGAGED
```

The regex misses, `data-tauri` is set, and the iPad went transparent again —
**the same black screen, reintroduced on half the declared device scope by the
fix for it.** Fixed in `fbacc48` by adding the standard iPadOS discriminator
(`navigator.platform === 'MacIntel' && navigator.maxTouchPoints > 1`; a real Mac
reports `0`), with the CSP hash recomputed. **Verified on device:**
`dataTauriAttr: null` and the iPad now renders the app correctly.

### `tauri-plugin-dialog` presents AND resolves on iOS — use it

The natural replacement for the 13 broken `window.confirm`/`alert` sites was
untested. Measured:

- **`message()` — presents a native panel and RESOLVES**: `{resolved: true,
  value: 'Ok'}` after tapping Ok.
- **`ask()` — presents** a two-button panel (screenshotted, "No" / "Yes").
  Its resolution was **not captured** — the probe's 20 s timeout elapsed before
  the tap landed. Same plugin and same IPC path as `message()`, so it very
  likely resolves, but that is **inferred, not measured**.

This is the decisive difference from `window.confirm`, which returns an
always-truthy Promise. `dialog:allow-ask` / `allow-message` / `allow-confirm`
are already granted in the cross-platform `capabilities/default.json`, and
`native.js:85` `showMessage()` already routes through this plugin on Tauri — so
the fix for the data-loss sites is to make `backupFlow.js` call `showMessage()`
(async) instead of `window.confirm`.

### The updater error is real and user-visible

Screenshotted on first launch: a toast reading **"Updater error: Command
`check_update_on_channel` not found"**. Spec D1 predicted exactly this —
`isTauri` is true on iOS, so `updateFlow.js`'s startup check calls a
`#[cfg(desktop)]` command. Confirms the 2.1 App Store rejection risk.

## Task 6 — contentEditable spike — **PASSED on physical hardware**

**Device:** Ash's iPhone (iPhone 16 Pro, `iPhone17,1`), real hardware, not the
Simulator. Build: `tauri ios build --debug --target aarch64`, installed via
`xcrun devicectl device install app`. Development-provisioned under team
`847VH25R7U` using the pre-existing wildcard profile `847VH25R7U.*` — so no App
ID registration and no free-personal-team 7-day limit were needed, contrary to
the plan's assumption.

**Result, reported by the developer:** the app works, nothing is broken, and
**tapping into résumé text places the caret correctly and selection handles drag
correctly** — inside the `transform: scale()`d subtree at phone zoom. The
remaining issues are UI/UX, "in the context of it being an iOS app."

### This refutes D7's premise and shrinks Phase 3

D7 ("disable `contentEditable` on mobile; tap → select → edit in a sheet")
existed **solely** to sidestep the caret/selection risk, which the spec called
"the largest genuinely unverified risk in the entire port." That risk did not
materialise. On-page editing works on iOS.

**Therefore D7 must be revised before Phase 3 is planned.** It changes from
*"rewrite the mobile editing model"* to *"harden the existing editor for
touch"* — a large scope reduction. The plan's own contingency said exactly this:
"If they work, on-page editing reopens and D7 gets revisited."

**What is NOT thereby answered** — these were not part of the caret/selection
check and remain open:

- **Autocorrect persistence.** There are still **zero** `autocorrect` /
  `autocapitalize` attributes anywhere in `src/`, and `inlineEditor.js:975`
  writes `element.textContent` straight to storage. iOS rewriting `Kubernetes`
  or `SaaS` and *persisting* it is still a live risk. Required regardless.
- **Keyboard avoidance.** Every ancestor is `overflow: hidden`, so a focused
  field physically cannot scroll above the software keyboard. Still needs the
  `visualViewport` work.
- **The AI Apply/Reject dead-end.** `inlineEditor.js:58` still gates that menu on
  `mouseover`, and `startEditing()` calls `hideAIButton()` at `:785`. Caret
  working does not make a hover-only menu tappable. Still needs a touch surface —
  but it can now be solved *in place* rather than by rehosting the whole editor
  in a sheet.
- **Pinch-zoom conflict (D8).** `index.html` has no `maximum-scale`, so WKWebView
  page zoom fights `zoomControls.js`'s `transform: scale()`. With on-page editing
  retained this becomes **more** load-bearing, not less — the plan predicted this
  exact trade.

### Phase 0 status after this

Every spike in the plan has now returned a result. Outstanding items are no
longer unknowns, only work: the desktop runtime gate (`tauri:dev` PDF export +
update check), the option-C re-test with an opaque iframe, and three upstream
issues to file.
