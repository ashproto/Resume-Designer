/**
 * An apply is confirmed against the DISK, never against the cache in front of
 * it.
 *
 * These tests run the REAL appStorage — a write-behind cache over an injected
 * backend — against the REAL sync model, because the bug they exist for is
 * invisible to any test that asserts memory. `appStorage.setItem` updates a Map
 * and schedules the disk write 250ms later, and a write that fails is
 * deliberately KEPT in memory (appStorage.js). So the model could report a unit
 * applied, the transport could store the server's change tag for it, and the
 * device could relaunch holding its old content paired with that new tag — after
 * which its next edit is accepted by CloudKit as a clean update and destroys the
 * other device's newer version, silently.
 *
 * Every assertion below therefore reads `backend.files`, which is the disk. The
 * cache is only ever read to PROVE the difference: in the failure test it holds
 * the fetched value while the disk does not, which is exactly the state a
 * memory-asserting test would have called a pass.
