# Build On Paper for the iOS Simulator, install it on the booted device and
# launch it. Run from anywhere; paths are resolved from this script.
#
#   npm run ios:sim                       build, install, launch
#   npm run ios:sim -- --log              ...then stream the app's own log lines
#   OP_SIM_UDID=<udid> npm run ios:sim    ...onto a named device
#
# Why this exists rather than a line in the README:
#
#   1. `tauri ios dev` is unusable for simulators — it misclassifies every one
#      as a physical device. Build + `simctl` is the only working loop.
#   2. Tauri's post-build packaging fails with
#      `failed to rename app ...: Directory not empty (os error 66)` whenever
#      output from a previous build is still there. The failure is at the very
#      END of a long build, so it is easy to miss in a scrollback and then
#      spend a while reading logs from a stale binary that never had your
#      change in it. The two `rm -rf`s below are the whole fix.
#   3. Renaming or adding a Swift file under `src-tauri/ios/` needs
#      `xcodegen generate`, because the Xcode project is committed source now
#      (docs/ios/xcode-project-ownership.md). Doing it every time is cheap and
#      idempotent; forgetting it produces a confusing "Build input file cannot
#      be found".
#   4. `simctl ... booted` is not a device. It is "whichever booted device
#      simctl picks", so with two simulators up it can resolve to the other
#      one — and then the build succeeds, the install succeeds, and you are
#      testing the PREVIOUS binary on the device you are actually looking at.
#      That is note 2's failure mode with none of its warning signs; it cost a
#      wrong "the fix does not work" during the pinch-zoom work. So resolve one
#      device up front and address it by UDID everywhere below.
