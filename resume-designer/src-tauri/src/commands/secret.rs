//! OS credential store for the app's secrets.
//!
//! `commands/storage.rs` writes each key to a plaintext file under
//! `<app_data_dir>/storage/`, which is the right home for resume content but
//! the wrong one for a credential: that directory is swept into Time Machine,
//! Backblaze and any folder-sync tool, so a plaintext API key travels into
//! every backup image the user ever makes. These commands put it in the
//! macOS Keychain / Windows Credential Manager instead, encrypted at rest and
//! prompting when another application reaches for it.
//!
//! The JS facade in `src/secretStore.js` is the only caller.
//!
//! ## `Ok(None)` and `Err` are NOT interchangeable
//!
//! `secret_get` reports "no entry stored" as `Ok(None)` and "the keychain
//! could not be reached" as `Err`. Callers must keep these apart. The boot
//! migration deletes the plaintext original once the keychain copy is in
//! place, and a locked or denied keychain collapsing into `Ok(None)` would
//! read as *the user has no key*, sending that migration down the path where
//! it destroys the only durable copy. `src/secretStore.js` preserves the
//! distinction; do not "simplify" it away on either side.
