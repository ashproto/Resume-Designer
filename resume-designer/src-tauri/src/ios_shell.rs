//! Installs the native iOS chrome (`src-tauri/ios/OPShell.swift`).
//!
//! tao keeps `start_app()`, the application lifecycle and the run loop, and
//! builds the whole UIKit hierarchy exactly as it does today. Once the window
//! is scene-attached — which is `ios_view.rs`'s job, and this module waits for
//! it rather than duplicating it — we call a Swift `@objc` class that:
//!
//!   1. builds a `UIHostingController` around a real SwiftUI `NavigationStack`,
//!   2. makes it the window's `rootViewController`, and
//!   3. moves wry's existing `WKWebView` into a container inside it.
//!
//! That is the entire Rust side. Everything visible is ordinary Swift; nothing
//! here composes UI. See `docs/ios/swiftui-lifecycle-spike.md` for why the
//! alternative — Swift owning `@main` — is ruled out rather than deferred.
//!
//! The Swift is compiled straight from `src-tauri/ios/`: `project.yml` lists it
//! as a source path (see `docs/ios/xcode-project-ownership.md`). There is no
//! copy step.
//!
//! Set `OP_NATIVE_SHELL=0` in the scheme's environment to launch the plain web
//! shell instead — the A/B control when deciding whether a bug is the chrome's.
