// The native iOS chrome for On Paper.
//
// tao owns the application lifecycle, the run loop, the UIWindow and the
// WKWebView, exactly as it does on every other platform. Once the window is
// scene-attached, `src-tauri/src/ios_shell.rs` calls `installShell` here, which
// makes a UIHostingController the window's rootViewController and moves wry's
// existing WKWebView into it. See docs/ios/swiftui-lifecycle-spike.md for why
// this is the only route that keeps Tauri whole — inverting the lifecycle so
// Swift owns `@main` is not merely hard, it is ruled out by an assertion in tao.
//
// The webview keeps rendering the résumé canvas, which is not negotiable: PDF
// export hands WKWebView's `createPDF` the live app DOM, so a SwiftUI résumé
// would mean a second rendering engine drifting from the first. What this file
// replaces is only the chrome AROUND that canvas.
//
// This file is compiled straight from here — `project.yml` adds `../../ios` as
// a source path. Do not copy it into `gen/apple/Sources`.
// Its JS counterpart is `src/iosShell.js`; the two share a wire contract that
// is unit-tested there (test/iosShell.test.js).
