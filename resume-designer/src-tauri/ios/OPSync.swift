// CloudKit transport. Zones, records, conflicts — driven by `CKSyncEngine`.
//
// **This file never parses a payload.** A unit crosses as
// `{ id, kind, payload, modifiedAt, profileId }` with `payload` an opaque JSON string,
// because decomposing the résumé document is schema knowledge and the native
// side does not hold any. That is also what makes a future Mac client a
// transport-only job: it reimplements this file and nothing below it.
//
// Its JS counterpart is src/sync/syncModel.js.
//
// **Why CKSyncEngine and not CKDatabase.** This file used to hand-roll the
// transport, and its four worst bugs were one bug: record change tags, change
// tokens, batching and backoff are a single mechanism, and reimplementing any
// part of it means owning all of it. The one worth writing down is the silent
// one, because the build was green and the app looked like it was syncing:
// a save assembled from a FRESH `CKRecord` carries no `recordChangeTag`, so
// `.ifServerRecordUnchanged` answered `serverRecordChanged` to EVERY push, the
// tie-break handed the server the win every time, and no local edit ever
// reached iCloud. The others were of a piece — non-conflict failures were
// dropped so a caller could not tell "all saved" from "nothing saved", the
// conflict retry threw away its own result, and the change token was advanced
// past records that had been discarded, so they were never fetched again.
//
// CKSyncEngine owns the tags, the tokens, the batching and the retry. It owns
// the tags only if the app hands back the record it last saw, though, which is
// why `systemFields` below is persisted rather than merely cached — an
// in-memory map would reintroduce the bug above once per launch, for every
// unit.
