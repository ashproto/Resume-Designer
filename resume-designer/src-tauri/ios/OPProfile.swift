// The Profile sheet.
//
// A separate file from OPShell.swift, which is the shell itself: this one owns
// only the profile editor. `project.yml` adds `../../ios` as a source path, so
// anything here compiles with no further wiring.
//
// Its JS counterpart is src/profileBridge.js.
//
// Seven navigation rows, not seven tabs. The web dialog is a 172px rail beside
// a 740px pane — the rail alone is 44% of a 390pt screen — and its Contact tab
// puts nine fields in two columns. Each section pushes its own screen instead,
// which is also what gives Experience the room to be a list of employers rather
// than a stack of cards with five buttons each.
//
// **Swift never learns the profile's schema.** Every field arrives as
// `{path, label, value, kind}` and goes back as `setField(path, value)` with
// the path echoed exactly as received, the same property that keeps the
// structure panel's path grammar single-sourced. The one control that is not a
// path is the employer name, because renaming an employer writes every role in
// the run at once and only the bridge knows which those are.
//
// **Nothing here calls the web's confirmations.** `confirmDestructive()` renders
// a Radix AlertDialog inside the webview, behind this sheet, where its promise
// would never settle. Deleting an employer and answering the import's grouping
// question are native dialogs, asked BEFORE the action is sent.
