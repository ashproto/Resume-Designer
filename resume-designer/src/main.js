// this says yes; it cannot ask the DOM itself (it is storage-only, and the same
// file runs on iOS), so main.js hands it the question.
// The web's inline editor OR a focused native structure field. Both are "a
// person is typing into this résumé right now", and the DOM answer cannot see
// the SwiftUI one — see nativeEditingBusy.
//
// …OR a PDF capture, which is not typing but has the same requirement: the

 *      in flight. Profiles resolve AFTER this probe (see init()), so on a
 *      profiled store the guard below would read past the mapping: the

 *      so it can never be a fresh-from-Electron store.
 *   4. Only runs when the current store (appStorage) has no
 *      `resume-designer-data` — so a user who's already created
 *      content in the new build won't have it overwritten.
 *
 * Failures are swallowed (logged to console only) so a corrupt LevelDB
 * or permission error can never block boot. The user can still get
 * their data via Tools → Import Backup if they have a JSON elsewhere.
