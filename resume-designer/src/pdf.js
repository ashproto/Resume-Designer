 * Generate the PDF from the MAIN window, for iOS.
 *
 * The desktop flow above spawns a second, off-screen `WebviewWindow` at
 * `/print.html`. iOS Tauri is single-window — an iOS app has one `UIWindow` —
 * and `x`/`y`/`decorations`/`skipTaskbar` are desktop-only options, so that
 * constructor emits `tauri://error` immediately and the export dies with
 * "Print window creation failed". Phase 0 proved `createPDF` itself works on
 * iOS (63,168 bytes returned); it was the window on top of it that never could.
 *
 * So iOS captures the window it already has, using the SAME `html.pdf-export-mode`
 * stylesheet the print window applies to itself: chrome hidden, the zoom
 * transform and its scroll-margins removed, `.resume` planted at the document
 * origin at 8.5in. No re-render is needed — a transform does not affect layout,
 * so the on-screen pagination was already measured at the export width.
 *
 * The visible cost is a brief flash of the export layout, which the desktop
 * flow deliberately avoids. There is no way around it with one window, and the
 * preview dialog opens over it immediately afterwards.
 *
 * @param {string|null} variantId ignored — the main window always holds the
 *   current variant. Bridge exports of OTHER variants are desktop-only for the
 *   same single-window reason; the caller rejects them before reaching here.
