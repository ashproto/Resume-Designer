// The single fix-up point for a value arriving from a backup envelope. Both
// import formats route their owned-key writes through here, so anything that
// must be true of EVERY imported value belongs in this function rather than at
// one of the call sites — the credential strip was originally applied per-site
// and the format-1 replacement path was simply missed.
//
// Three jobs:
//
// 1. Legacy Electron stores can hold job descriptions as an id-keyed OBJECT map
//    — a shape the Rust migration probe explicitly counts as valid and the
//    envelope passes through verbatim — but jobDescriptions.js requires an
//    array (it spreads/filters the parsed value). Canonicalize on import;
//    anything else (already an array, unparseable) is written unchanged.
//
// 2. Strip a legacy `settings.openrouterKey` out of the data blob. Backups
//    written before the keychain move still carry it, and on a fresh install
//    with an empty keychain it would land in plaintext, go live immediately,
//    and be promoted into the keychain on the next boot — an old backup quietly
//    restoring a credential the exclusion policy says it must not.
//
//    `keepCredential` exempts BOTH Electron paths — the automatic upgrade in
//    main.js and the manual "import from previous installation" in
//    backupFlow.js. Each is a MIGRATION of the user's own live data on this
//    machine, not the restore of a backup FILE. The test is where the data came
//    from, not which function is calling: a file could have come from any
//    machine, the LevelDB store next door could not. Stripping deleted the key
//    outright, and on the automatic path it then stamped
//    the migration flag `imported`, so it never ran again and the user came up
//    permanently without the AI credential they had configured. Kept, it flows
//    through the ordinary upgrade pipeline instead — extractSharedApiKey moves
//    it to the shared key, initSecretStore moves that into the keychain and
//    strips the plaintext — the same path every pre-keychain user already takes
//    on first launch of this version. The plaintext hop is momentary and on the
//    same disk the Electron app was already keeping the key on in the clear, so
//    it exposes nothing that was not already exposed.
//
// 3. Drop the backup's `deviceId` out of the sync-state key. That key belongs in
//    a backup — the per-unit modification stamps in it are per-profile data — but
//    the id beside them names the MACHINE, and restoring one device's backup onto
//    a second gave both the same origin id, which is what undo scopes itself by.
//    NOT exempted by `keepCredential`: a same-machine Electron migration predates
//    sync entirely and carries no such key, so there is nothing for an exemption
//    to preserve. See withoutDeviceIdentity for the rest of the argument.
