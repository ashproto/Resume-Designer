/**
 * The bridge to the native iOS shell.
 *
 * On iOS the chrome is SwiftUI (`src-tauri/ios/OPShell.swift`) and only the
 * résumé canvas is web. This module is the seam between them. It is
 * deliberately a DISPATCHER, not a second implementation: every command routes
 * to the same function or the same DOM control the web chrome uses, so the two
 * shells cannot drift.
 *
 * Direction and transport:
 *
 *   Swift → JS   `webView.evaluateJavaScript("window.__opShell.command(json)")`
 *   JS → Swift   `window.webkit.messageHandlers.opShell.postMessage(snapshot)`
 *
 * The message handler is added by Swift when it installs the shell, so its
 * presence is also how the web side knows a native shell is there at all.
 * Nothing here runs on desktop or in the browser: `activate()` is only ever
 * called by Swift.
 *
 * The two pure pieces — `buildSnapshot` and `createCommandDispatcher` — carry
 * the contract and are unit-tested (test/iosShell.test.js). The rest is glue
 * that cannot be tested without a WKWebView.
