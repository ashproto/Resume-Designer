/**
 * appStorage — the single persistence facade for every owned key.
 *
 * Why: webview localStorage has a hard ~5MB per-origin quota (WKWebView /
 * WebView2). At quota, writes silently fail and user data (new resumes, edits)
 * vanished. On desktop we therefore persist to real files via Rust commands
 * (one file per key under <AppData>/storage/, atomic tmp+rename writes) —
 * disk-limited, user-visible, Time-Machine friendly.
 *
 * Modes:
 *  - passthrough (browser build, jsdom tests, and pre-init): direct
 *    localStorage calls, synchronous, flush() is a no-op. Identical to the
 *    pre-rework behavior, so the quota guards in persistence.js still matter.
 *  - cached (Tauri, after initAppStorage()): everything is loaded once into an
 *    in-memory Map; reads are synchronous from the cache; each set/remove
 *    marks the key dirty and a coalesced drain write-behinds it to disk.
 *
 * Contract: on Tauri, `await initAppStorage()` MUST run before any module
 * reads or writes storage — it is the first line of init() in main.js (and of
 * printEntry.js with { readOnly: true }). Boot order is already a fragile
 * contract in this app (see maybeAutoMigrateLegacyData); this extends it.
