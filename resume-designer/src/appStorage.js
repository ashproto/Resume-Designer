 * (one file per key under <AppData>/storage/, atomic tmp+rename writes) —
 * disk-limited, user-visible, Time-Machine friendly.
 *
 * Modes:
 *  - passthrough (browser build, jsdom tests, and pre-init): direct
 *    localStorage calls, synchronous, flush() is a no-op. Identical to the
 *    pre-rework behavior, so the quota guards in persistence.js still matter.
 *  - cached (Tauri, after initAppStorage()): everything is loaded once into an
 *    in-memory Map; reads are synchronous from the cache; each set/remove
 *    marks the key dirty and a coalesced drain write-behinds it to disk.
 *
 * Contract: on Tauri, `await initAppStorage()` MUST run before any module
 * reads or writes storage — it is the first line of init() in main.js (and of
 * printEntry.js with { readOnly: true }). Boot order is already a fragile
 * contract in this app (see maybeAutoMigrateLegacyData); this extends it.

// (src/sync/syncKeys.js), an interceptor that asks it cannot drift from it, and
// a call site added later is simply forgotten — which is exactly how the gap
// this closes opened in the first place.
//
// This file cannot import the sync layer (the sync layer imports THIS file), so
// main.js installs the observer, the same graph edge it already owns for

//
// `onWrite(logicalKey, value, previous)` is handed the LOGICAL key, because
// that is what `classifyKey` takes — a physical, profile-namespaced key comes

// write replaced, and it is what lets the observer tell a `resume-designer-data`
// write that changed `settings` from one that only touched a résumé.

// that batch's writes have actually run — not when they were queued. The
// observer accumulates ids in onWrite and notifies ONCE per window there, and
// the set names the keys whose bytes were refused so it can hold those back.
// The barrier is the point: whatever the observer announces, something uploads,
// so announcing before the disk has taken the bytes hands the server content
// this device may never hold. That matters: the application-notes field writes on every
