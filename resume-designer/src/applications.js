 * which wrote the stale cache over it, stamped the unit, and — the transport
 * legitimately holding the record's change tag, because the page had confirmed
 * the apply — pushed the revert up as a clean, uncontested update. No conflict
 * was raised and the other device's records were gone. Same trap as
 * store.adoptDocument's, and the same answer: the owner adopts, rather than
 * being written behind.
 *
 * `notify()` and not merely a cache swap: React reads this module through
 * useSyncExternalStore (hooks/useApplications.js), so a corrected cache with no
 * notification leaves the Library rendering a list that no longer exists.
 *
 * A value it cannot read leaves the cache alone — absence is never deletion,
 * and one malformed remote unit must not empty someone's application history.
 * The list this device holds is then still the one the next local write puts
 * back on disk, so the bad bytes are corrected rather than inherited.

 * note — and the next keystroke wrote that stale text back over the adopted
