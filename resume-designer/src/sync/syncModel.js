 * count it as applied. So mergeData is asked instead: merging a unit into an
 * empty blob touches nothing but `variants` unless the field is one it knows.
 *
 * The VALUE has to land too, not just the field: `null` parses fine and
 * mergeData writes it, so the payload `'null'` blanked `settings` or
 * `userProfile` wholesale off one malformed remote unit — and counted as
 * applied. Both are objects in every shape the app writes, so a null there is a
 * broken record, not a value.
 *
 * `null` was only the reachable half of that, though — the one `String(null)`
 * coercion produces. Refusing it alone still let `'[]'`, `'5'` and `'"x"'`
 * through, and the chain past the write is the same one `landsAsResume` and
 * KEY_OWNERS close for their units, a field further in: the garbage lands on
 * disk and counts applied, so this device keeps the change tag; `getUserProfile`
 * returns it because it is TRUTHY; `completeProfile` normalises it to a
 * defaults-shaped EMPTY profile; and the next debounced save persists that empty
 * profile and pushes it up as a clean, uncontested update. Absence became
 * deletion one restart later. `data:settings` is the lower-stakes twin —
 * `saveSettings`' `{ ...[], ...rest }` degrades every preference to its default.
 *
 * So the question asked is the honest one — is this a value of the shape the
 * field holds — and both fields hold an OBJECT in every shape the app writes.
 * An array is refused with the scalars: `typeof [] === 'object'` is a fact about
 * JavaScript, not about a settings blob. An explicitly EMPTY object still lands;
 * that is a profile someone cleared, not an absence, exactly as an explicitly
 * empty list lands for a KEY_OWNERS key.

 * that module's next ordinary write, which put the stale copy back, stamped the
 * unit, and — this device legitimately holding the record's change tag, because
 * the page had confirmed the apply — pushed the revert up as a clean,
 * uncontested update. No conflict was raised and nothing was parked: the other
 * device's content was simply gone. The résumé had exactly this bug and
 * `store.adoptDocument` is exactly this answer.
 *
 * `adopt()` re-reads storage rather than being handed the payload, so the
 * module's copy is by construction the bytes that reached the key — one source
 * of truth, and no second parser to disagree with the module's own.
 *
 * `lands()` is `landsAsResume` for these keys, and it exists because refusing in
 * `adopt()` alone protects only MEMORY. A payload the owner cannot read was
 * still written, and still counted — so the bad bytes sat on the key while the
 * cache quietly kept the good list. That is survivable exactly as long as the
 * process lives: restart before that module's next local write and its init
 * reads the garbage, degrades it to `[]` — every one of these owners degrades
 * the same way, and loadThreads goes further and manufactures a fresh empty
 * conversation — and the first save afterwards persists the empty list and
 * pushes it up as a clean, uncontested update. Absence became deletion one
 * restart later. So the question is asked BEFORE the write, on the owner's own
 * reader, and a refusal shortens `applied` the way every other refusal here
 * does: the transport forfeits the change tag and re-offers the unit.
 *
 * `isBusy()` is the résumé's `interruptsLiveEditing` rule for a different
 * screen. The chat needs one because adopting there replaces the thread list a
 * streamed reply commits into, and that reply exists nowhere else until it
 * does — and the application note and the job-edit dialog need one for the same
 * reason a level down: each seeds a draft from the record ONCE, so a unit
 * adopted underneath leaves the draft showing pre-sync text that the next save
 * writes back over the adopted copy, stamped as a fresh local change. It is asked BEFORE the write, never after — a unit that reaches storage
 * is on disk whatever the owner then does with it, and disk disagreeing with
 * memory is the failure this whole path exists to avoid.

 * generalisation is the whole of this rule. Guarding the résumés alone left
 * `data:settings`, `data:userProfile`, the applications and job lists, the chat
 * threads, the learned answers and the profile registry landing unconditionally
 * — and the race that costs is worse than losing the newer copy, because it
 * LEGITIMISES the older one:
 *
 *  1. A local edit writes the key, which stamps the unit here and queues the
 *     native dirty notification, which waits for the storage drain.
 *  2. An OLDER server record arrives inside that window and is applied. The
 *     newer local value is overwritten and the module that owns the key adopts
 *     the old one.
 *  3. The already-pending notification then uploads that STALE payload carrying
 *     the NEWER local timestamp, under the change tag the apply just earned. It
 *     goes up as a clean, uncontested update, and no later comparison can undo
 *     it: the old version is now the newest one everywhere.

 * path and the save-time conflict path (`resolveConflicts`) cannot disagree

 * the transport having stopped keeping a second one in Swift. Including on the

 *
 * NOT asked of the two append-shaped units — see `accumulatorFor`. They union,
 * and a union does not need to be newer to be right.
 *

 * count makes the transport forfeit the record's change tag, so the next save

 * is the authoritative state. The two below have no such delete: token events
 * are never pruned (`tokenTrackingService.js`), and a version-history entry is

 * Land units that arrived from another device.

 * has OPEN is handed to the store as well, because that document lives in
 * memory too (adoptLoadedDocument). A résumé is refused outright when it
 * carries no document (landsAsResume) and when it would land on an edit still
 * in flight (interruptsLiveEditing); a refusal destroys nothing — see
 * interruptsLiveEditing for where a refused unit goes.
 *
 * Token usage and version history, the two units that accumulate, take the
 * union rule (accumulatorFor). EVERY OTHER unit is a snapshot, and every
 * snapshot must be newer than the copy this device holds or it is refused
 * (outranksLocalCopy) — résumés, both `data:` fields and every plain key alike.
 * A unit naming a device-local key is refused: nothing should have sent it, and
 * honouring it would let one device's zoom overwrite another's.
 *
 * A key something holds a whole in-memory copy of — the applications list, the
 * job list, the chat threads — is not finished by the storage write either, for
 * the same reason the résumé is not: the owner is asked to adopt what was just
 * written, and asked FIRST whether it can. See KEY_OWNERS.
 *
 * Every write below goes through the storage interceptor, so the whole landing
 * runs with stamping suppressed — see `applying` for what an echo would cost.
 * The flag is restored in a `finally`: this reaches store.js, which can throw,
 * and suppression left on would silently stop every later local edit from ever
 * being uploaded — a failure with no symptom until another device is missing
 * a day's work.
 *
 * ── WHAT `applied` MEANS, AND WHY THIS FUNCTION IS ASYNC ──────────────────
 *
 * `applied` is how many units are DURABLY this device's — on disk, not in a
 * cache — and that is the whole of this function's answer to the transport.
 * The count is the only thing `deliver` (OPSync.swift) keeps the server's
 * change tags on, and a change tag is a claim to know which server version this
 * device is editing.
 *
 * It used to be the count that reached STORAGE, which on every shipped desktop
 * and iOS build is a write-behind cache: `appStorage.setItem` updates a Map and
 * schedules the disk write 250ms later, and a failed write is deliberately kept
 * in memory rather than dropped (see appStorage.js). So the count was true of
 * the cache and said nothing about the disk. Kill the app inside that window —
 * or let the write fail — and it relaunches holding its OLD content paired with
 * the NEW change tag; its next edit of that unit is accepted by CloudKit as a
 * clean update and destroys the other device's newer version. No
 * `serverRecordChanged`, nothing parked, nothing logged. Apple states the
 * requirement directly: CKSyncEngine state must be persisted alongside the app
 * data and the fetched changes it was earned from (CKSyncEngineEvent.h). Here
 * the content and the sync state are two independent stores, and this await is
 * the durability barrier between them.
 *
 * `appStorage.flush()` is that barrier, and it already answers exactly the right
 * question — `true` when every awaited write reached disk, `false` when any of
 * them failed. Its answer is whole-store rather than per-key, so a failure
 * anywhere makes this report ZERO: which units landed is not knowable, and the
 * only honest reading of that is "none of them are confirmed". Over-forfeiting
 * costs one round trip (the next save quotes no tag, CloudKit answers
 * `serverRecordChanged`, both copies are compared and the loser is parked);
 * under-forfeiting is the silent overwrite above. Nothing is destroyed by a
 * `0` — the content is still on the server, still on the device that wrote it,
 * and still in this device's cache on its way to disk.
 *
 * ── THE AWAIT IS OUTSIDE THE SUPPRESSED WINDOW, DELIBERATELY ──────────────
 *
 * `landFetchedUnits` stays entirely synchronous and the `applying` flag is
 * restored in the `finally` BEFORE anything is awaited, so the suppressed window
 * is still one run-to-completion turn of the event loop: no local write can
 * interleave with it and be swallowed as an echo, which is what makes the flag
 * safe at all. Nothing below the `finally` may ever move above it.

 * was a second copy of a rule both devices have to compute identically, and it
 * was simply wrong for the two units that do not take newer-wins at all: the
 * loser of a token-usage or version-history conflict went to `parkLoser`, which
 * has nowhere to put a unit that is not a résumé, so CloudKit ended up holding
 * ONE SIDE rather than the union. The other device's events survived only in
 * this device's local copy, and a reinstall before the next local append made
 * them unrecoverable. The fetch path had honoured the union rule all along;
 * only the save path did not.
 *
 * So the transport carries both opaque versions across and decides nothing.
 * Each conflict is `{ local, server }` — the unit this device tried to send and
 * the one the server answered with — and the answer is, per unit:
 *
 *     { id, retry }   `retry`: does the SERVER still owe an update?
 *
 * plus `parked`, the number of losers that reached a version history. That
 * count is the only thing the conflict notice is raised on, and only this side
 * can produce it: a union has no loser, and a snapshot whose loser is not a
 * résumé has nowhere to park one.
 *
 * A unit MISSING from `resolved` is a refusal, and refusing is the safe
 * direction: the transport forfeits that record's change tag, queues no save,
 * and offers the unit again at the next start, where the whole comparison
 * happens over. Nothing is destroyed by one — both versions are still where
 * they were.
 *
 * ── WHAT THE RETRY ACTUALLY SENDS ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Not a payload handed back over the bridge. The resolution is written to
 * STORAGE here, and the transport re-queues the record and asks for it again at
 * send time (`recordToSend` → `collectUnit`). That is the only reading of "the
 * resolved unit" that cannot go stale: a local edit landing between the
 * resolution and the send collapses into the same queued change, so a payload
 * cached on the Swift side would be sent INSTEAD of that edit and the edit would
 * never be named again. Asking at send time yields the resolution, or something
 * newer built on top of it, and both are correct — what matters for the change
 * tag is that the SERVER'S version is accounted for here, which it is: merged,
 * applied, or parked.
 *
 * ── THE SAME TWO RULES `applyUnits` RUNS UNDER, FOR THE SAME REASONS ───────
 *
 * Everything below runs SYNCHRONOUSLY inside the `applying` window, and the one
 * await is textually after the `finally` that restores the flag — so the
 * suppressed region is still a single run-to-completion turn and no local write
 * can interleave with it and be swallowed as an echo. `mergeHistory`,
 * `mergeTokenUsage`, `landFetchedUnits` and `parkLoser` are all synchronous,
 * which is what makes that possible. Nothing here may ever move above that
 * `finally`.
 *
 * And the durability barrier: a resolution that reached the write-behind cache
 * is not a resolution. The transport keeps the SERVER's change tag on this
 * answer, and a tag is a claim to know which server version this device is
 * editing — a claim a device that relaunches without the bytes cannot make. So
 * the answer waits for the disk, and a failed flush forfeits the WHOLE batch,
 * including the units that wrote nothing: which ones landed is not knowable, and
 * over-forfeiting costs one round trip while under-forfeiting is a silent
 * overwrite.

/**
 * Park a conflict's losing version in that résumé's history.
 *
 * This is what makes newer-wins safe: nothing is destroyed, and recovery is a
 * restore the app already supports. Only résumés have history, so a non-résumé
 * unit returns false rather than inventing somewhere to put it.
 *
 * The stored value at `HISTORY_PREFIX + variantId` is NOT a bare array — it is
 * `{ history: [...], historyIndex }`, written and read by store.js
 * (saveHistory/loadHistory) and rendered by HistoryDialog.jsx, whose entries
 * carry `{ data, timestamp, description, changeType }`. Writing any other
 * shape — or writing to any other key — would park the loser somewhere the
 * version-history dialog can never read it back from, which is a silent data
 * loss dressed up as a successful park.
 *
 * An entry's `data` is the DOCUMENT, and the unit's payload is the whole
 * variant RECORD around it (resumeDocument). Parking the record put the wrong
 * shape one level up: the entry listed and restored fine, and restoring it
 * produced a near-empty résumé named after the variant, because `name` is the
 * only field the two shapes share. That is the same silent loss as writing the
 * wrong key, only harder to see — the whole conflict design rests on a parked
 * loser being RESTORABLE, or "newer wins, nothing is discarded" is not true.
 * A payload with no document is refused for that reason rather than parked:
 * `resolveConflicts` counts what actually landed, and a version that is not in
 * Version history must not be announced as being there.
 *
 * WHERE in that array the entry goes decides whether it survives at all, and
 * both halves of this function are written to the same rule — the entry goes in
 * BELOW `historyIndex`, at `historyIndex - 1`:
 *
 * - Everything after `historyIndex` is store.js's redo future, and pushHistory
 *   (store.js) splices the future away on the very next local edit. Appending
 *   there and leaving the index alone — the obvious reading of "don't change
 *   what's current" — parks the loser exactly where one keystroke deletes it.
 * - In the past it is out of that splice's reach, and the index still points at
 *   the same ENTRY it pointed at before, so the live document's notion of
 *   "current" is unchanged. Only its numeric position moved.
 * - Below the index rather than AT it, because the index moves up with it: an
 *   entry at `historyIndex` would make the LOSER what `historyIndex` points at,
 *   and that has to stay the entry the document is on. See store.js's
 *   adoptHistoryEntry, which the loaded-variant path shares this rule with, for
 *   why it is not index 0 either.
 *
 * Undo staying away from the parked entry is store.js's job, not this rule's:
 * it skips `sync-conflict` entries wherever they ended up, which is the only
 * thing that covers the arrangements no placement here can (a history whose
 * index is already 0, and a variant with no history at all — below).
 *
 * That is necessary but not sufficient for the variant the app currently has
 * open: store.js holds that variant's history in memory and saveHistory rewrites
 * the whole key from that array, which never saw this entry. So the loaded
 * variant is handed to the store instead of written here.
