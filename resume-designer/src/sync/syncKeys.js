/**
 * Which storage keys sync, and which stay on the device.
 *
 * Exhaustive by construction over TWO inventories from `profileKeys.js`:
 * `BACKUP_FIXED_KEYS` (the backup/restore system) and `SHARED_KEYS`
 * (machine-level keys — not exported directly; profileKeys.js exposes only
 * `isSharedKey`). A `SHARED_KEYS` member is not reached by the
 * `BACKUP_FIXED_KEYS` check below, so every one of them must appear in either
 * `DEVICE_LOCAL_KEYS` or `SYNCED_SHARED_KEYS`. Anything not named in one of
 * these three lists comes back 'unknown', and the exhaustiveness tests fail.
 * That is deliberate — a key added later without a sync decision must not
 * default to either answer. Defaulting to synced leaks device state (a
 * synced `currentVariantId` makes one device change documents because
 * another did); defaulting to local loses content silently.
