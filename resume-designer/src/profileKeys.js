/**
 * Profile key classification — pure, no imports (both appStorage.js and
 * profiles.js depend on this, so it must sit below both in the import graph).
 *
 * Physical layout: per-profile logical keys live at
 * `resume-p--<profileId>--<logicalKey>`. The prefix starts with `resume-`
 * deliberately so appStorage's one-time localStorage→disk adoption
 * (OWNED_PREFIX = 'resume-') still matches namespaced keys.
 *
 * `--` is the separator because physical keys become FILENAMES in the Rust
 * disk store, whose validate_key allows only [A-Za-z0-9._-] (':' broke every
 * namespaced write on device). Parsing stays unambiguous because profile ids
 * are strictly alphanumeric (no '-'): the first `--` after the prefix always
 * ends the id. `resume-p--` cannot collide with logical keys ('resume-photo-*'
 * shares only 'resume-p').

 * getSettings still reads `settings.openrouterKey` as the pre-extraction
 * fallback, and extractSharedApiKey only clears that field for the ACTIVE

 * the kind a per-profile export targets — can still carry the key inside this

 * plaintext credential that the next boot's extraction would promote into the
 * keychain.

/**
 * Drop the device identity out of a `resume-designer-sync-state` value crossing
 * a backup boundary INWARDS — a full restore, a format-1 replace or merge, or a
 * per-profile import.
 *
 * That key is in BACKUP_FIXED_KEYS on its merits: the per-unit modification
 * stamps in it are genuinely per-profile data, and a backup that dropped them
 * would restore a workspace whose every unit reads as never-stamped, which
 * `resolveConflict` treats as -Infinity — it would lose every conflict it met.
 * So the key rides along and only this ONE field is removed.
 *
 * It has to be removed because it is the opposite kind of thing: `deviceId` is
 * store.js's name for THIS MACHINE, stamped as `origin` on every history entry
 * it writes, and undo traverses only entries carrying this device's own origin.
 * Seeding a second device from the first's backup — the natural migration path,
 * and one the iOS Settings sheet actively offers — therefore gave both devices
 * the same origin id, and "undo traverses only this device's own steps" silently
 * stopped holding between exactly the two devices most likely to be syncing with
 * each other.
 *
 * On the way IN rather than on the way OUT, for two reasons. The backups that
 * can carry a foreign id ALREADY EXIST, so stripping at export would leave every
 * one of them still able to clone an identity, and those are the files a person
 * migrating today actually has. And the boundary that matters is the receiving
 * device's: it is the only one that can know it must not adopt a name it did not
 * choose.
 *
 * Nothing here MINTS a replacement, deliberately. store.js's one-time memo
 * (deviceOrigin) is the single writer of this field, and it already generates
 * one when the field is absent — so removing it hands the job back to its owner
 * rather than adding a second generator that could race it or disagree with it
 * about the format. Every restore path reloads the window, and a profile switch
 * reloads too, so that memo is re-read from the restored key.
 *
 * The cost, stated plainly: restoring your OWN backup onto the SAME device also
 * mints a new id, so the restored history entries — all stamped with the old one
 * — read as foreign and undo will not step into them until new edits accumulate.
 * Nothing is lost; the version-history dialog still lists and restores every one
 * of them, since only the TRAVERSAL narrows (see store.js). It is accepted rather
 * than worked around because an import cannot tell a rollback from a migration:
 * both hand this device a file, and the only difference is which machine wrote
 * it, which the file does not honestly say. Guessing wrong in the other direction
 * clones an identity between two syncing devices, and that one is silent.
 *
 * Returns the value untouched when there is nothing to strip, including when it
 * will not parse — that is still the user's data and has to round-trip, exactly
 * as withoutLegacyCredential treats an unparseable blob.
