/**
 * The live User Profile working copy.
 *
 * `data:userProfile` is one sync unit (syncUnits.js's PLAIN_FIELDS), and
 * `saveUserProfile` (persistence.js) replaces that whole field from whatever
 * object it is handed. So the app's one long-lived copy of that object decides
 * whether a profile another device sent survives — and there is exactly one:
 * ProfileDialog's `profileRef`, a working copy taken when the dialog opens,
 * mutated in place by every field in it, and debounce-written back WHOLE. The
 * dialog is mounted for the app's whole lifetime (App.jsx renders it
 * unconditionally, so its `rd:profile-flush` listener is present even when
 * closed), so that ref long outlives any landing.
 *
 * The trap is the one KEY_OWNERS documents (src/sync/syncModel.js), one field
 * further in: a profile this device applied lasted exactly until the next
 * keystroke, whose debounced save wrote the OPEN-TIME snapshot back over the
 * merged field, stamped the unit (`changedDataUnits` sees a genuinely changed
 * payload) and — this device legitimately holding the record's change tag,
 * because the page had confirmed the apply — pushed the revert up as a clean,
 * uncontested update. No conflict was raised and nothing was parked: the other
 * device's profile was simply gone. The window is not a narrow one: the profile
 * editor is where someone types out a whole work history, so "open for minutes"
 * is its ordinary state.
 *
 * The native side designed this hazard out rather than fixing it after the fact
 * — see profileBridge.js's header, "There is no working copy on this side,
 * deliberately." The web dialog is exactly that working copy, and sync is a
 * second writer of the same shape as the interview merge it warns about.
 *
 * This module is a LEAF, and that is its whole reason to exist as a file:
 * syncModel.js must reach the holder without importing persistence.js (main.js
 * owns that graph edge — see registerPersistedSaveHandler), and the dialog must
 * reach it without importing the sync layer. Nothing is imported here.
