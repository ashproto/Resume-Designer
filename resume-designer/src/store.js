  // - An ordinary entry another device wrote, brought in by the union merge
  //   (adoptHistory). Edit on the phone, open the Mac, press Cmd+Z, and undo
  //   would hand back the phone's document rather than your own last state.
  //   Nothing is lost, but it reads as loss.
  //
  // An entry with NO `origin` is this device's. History was device-local before

  // existing history behind their own undo.
  //
  // Skipped entries stay exactly where they are in the array —
  // getHistoryEntries still lists them and restoreToEntry still restores them,
  // which is the entire point of keeping them. Only the traversal narrows.
  //
  // Doing it here rather than at each place such an entry can be inserted is
  // what makes the rule hold everywhere at once: at historyIndex 0 there is no
  // slot below the current entry for adoptHistoryEntry to use, a variant this
  // device has never opened can load with a park as its only entry, and a

      // the user never chose is the one on screen, and sync produces them two
      // ways:
      //
      // - A variant this device has never opened has no history for parkLoser
      //   to insert into, so syncModel.js's storage path writes `{ history:
      //   [loser], historyIndex: 0 }`. loadHistory takes its success path on
      //   that, so no 'Initial state' was pushed and the rejected version was
      //   marked current, permanently.
      // - A history unit for a variant that is not loaded is merged straight
      //   into its key, with mergeHistory's index — the NEWEST entry, which the
      //   union routinely takes from the other device. Nothing there is a park,
      //   so a park-only check passed, the dialog marked a remote entry
      //   current, and one edit plus one Cmd+Z put that device's résumé on
      //   screen.
      //
      // Recording the state actually on screen fixes both: it lands at the end,
      // so there is no redo future for pushHistory to splice away either, and
      // the merged entries survive. A missing entry (an empty history, or a
      // stored index that points past the array) is repaired the same way.
      //
      // What this must NOT ask is whether the current entry's data still EQUALS
      // the document. updateSilent writes UI-only state (an accordion's
      // `_expanded`, `experienceSortMode`) into `data` and persists it without
      // a history entry, by design — so that drift is ordinary and expected,
      // not a broken invariant. Re-pointing on it appended an 'Initial state'
      // every time a résumé was reopened after an accordion toggle, which

    // - `isDirty` — an edit this store has taken but no save has written yet.
    //   It also stands in for the OTHER half of the same race: the fetch path
    //   compares the remote stamp against the last PERSISTED one (syncModel's
    //   modifiedAtFor), and the save debounce has no max wait, so under
    //   continuous editing that stamp goes arbitrarily stale and a remote copy
    //   older than the live document can outrank it. Dirty says "the recorded
    //   time is not the document's time", which is the honest answer.
    // - `sessionActive`, passed in — an inline-editing session. Text typed into
    //   a contentEditable exists ONLY in the DOM until blur commits it through
    //   `update` (src/inlineEditor.js), so `isDirty` is false while a person is
    //   mid-word. This module has no DOM, so the caller reports it.
    //
    // Refusing rather than deferring is what the caller does with a true here,
    // and nothing is lost by it: the refusal shortens the applied count, the
    // transport forfeits the record's change tag, and the next save — which the
    // in-flight edit is about to trigger — meets the conflict path, where both
    // copies are compared and the loser is parked.
    // Whether `variantId` is the résumé on screen. The one question only this
    // module can answer — `currentVariantId` is private to it — and the sync

    // caller the storage write it has already done is the whole job.

    // It exists for the same reason adoptHistory and adoptHistoryEntry do, one
    // layer over: sync applies a fetched résumé by merging it into
    // `resume-designer-data` ON DISK, but the loaded variant's document also
    // lives HERE, in `data`, and the debounced save writes `data` back over
    // that blob. So an applied résumé survived exactly until the next save,
    // which wrote the stale in-memory document over it, stamped it with a fresh
    // `modifiedAt`, and — this device legitimately holding the server's change
    // tag, because the page had confirmed the apply — pushed it up as a clean,
    // uncontested update. No conflict was raised and nothing was parked. Only
    // the store can tell whether this is the variant on screen: currentVariantId
    // is private to it.
    //
    // `isDirty` goes FALSE and no save is scheduled: what is adopted is exactly
    // what the caller has just written to storage, so there is nothing left to
    // persist, and saving would restamp the unit and send back what this device
    // has only just received. A debounce already in flight cannot resurrect the
    // replaced document either — scheduleSave's timer re-reads isDirty when it
    // fires.
    //
    // The replaced document is not discarded silently. Every edit path records
    // its result in `history` (pushHistory) BEFORE the save debounce runs, so

    // restore away — which is where "newer wins" says a loser belongs. The one

    // updateSilent, and what it writes is transient UI state by definition (an
    // accordion's `_expanded`, the sort mode).
