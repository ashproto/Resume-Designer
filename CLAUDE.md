<!-- project-stack-start -->

This repo is **On Paper, formerly Resume Designer**, a Tauri 2 desktop app
(macOS + Windows) for designing resumes, with AI chat assistance and vector PDF
export. The app code lives in `resume-designer/`; the repo root also holds
`website/` (GitHub Pages marketing site) and `docs/`.

The directory name `resume-designer/`, the GitHub repo slug, the bundle
identifier `com.resumedesigner.app`, and every `resume-designer-*` storage key
are **deliberately unchanged** by the rename — they are paths and data
addresses, not branding. See "Project rules" below.

When working on build, packaging, signing, or updater code, **read
`resume-designer/TAURI.md` first** — it is the authoritative guide for the
Tauri setup and overrides anything you may assume about Tauri from training
data.

# CLAUDE.md

Project-specific guidance. Behavioral guidelines (Think Before Coding,
Simplicity First, Surgical Changes, Goal-Driven Execution) and the
model-selection policy for workflows/subagents live in the user-global
`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and apply here — do not duplicate them in this file.

## Commands

Run all of these from `resume-designer/`:

```bash
npm run dev          # browser-only dev server (no Tauri shell)
npm run tauri:dev    # desktop window with hot reload (Rust compile on first run)
npm run test         # vitest, single run
npm run test:watch   # vitest, watch mode
npm run lint         # eslint
npm run tauri:build  # production desktop build (see TAURI.md for targets)
```

## Layout

- `resume-designer/src/` — frontend: React 19 + Vite, plain JavaScript (`.jsx`/`.js`, no TypeScript). Service modules (AI streaming, storage, pagination, chat threads, diffing) are framework-free `.js` files at the top level; React components live in `src/components/`.
- `resume-designer/src/components/ui/` — shadcn/ui primitives (Radix + Tailwind 3 + CVA).
- `resume-designer/src-tauri/` — Rust side: `src/commands/` holds the Tauri command handlers.
- `resume-designer/test/` — vitest suites for the service modules; add tests here when changing them.
- `website/` — static marketing site, deployed to GitHub Pages on push to `main`.

## Project rules

### Git and releases

- **Never commit, push, or open a PR without being explicitly asked.**
- Conventional commits, enforced by commitlint in CI on **every commit in a PR** (both `main` and `next`): subjects must start lowercase (e.g. `fix(chat): …`).
- Branch flow: feature branches → `next` (beta channel) → promotion PR to `main`.
- The `next` **git tag** is the beta release anchor — never delete it. Use `refs/heads/next` / `origin/next` when you mean the branch, to avoid the branch/tag ambiguity.

### Naming (the "On Paper" rename)

The brand is **On Paper** — two words, title case, in all prose and display
copy. The authority is [docs/brand/on-paper-brand-guide.md](docs/brand/on-paper-brand-guide.md);
read it before writing user-facing copy.

Lowercase is **only** for constrained technical identifiers — places where a
space or capital is actually illegal or would be rejected:

- npm package `on-paper`, Rust lib `on_paper_lib`
- export/temp filenames (`on-paper-backup-*.json`, `on-paper-preview-*.pdf`)
- CI artifact names (`on-paper_<arch>.app.tar.gz`)
- the domain `onpaper.pro` (the `.pro` belongs to the address, not the name)

The test is necessity, not house style: if the literal string `On Paper` would
work there, use it. Never write `OnPaper`, `On paper`, `On-Paper`, or `ONPAPER`.

Transition phrasing, where existing users could be confused, is exactly
**"On Paper, formerly Resume Designer"**.

These are **frozen and must never be renamed**, however tempting a sweep looks:

- **The DESKTOP bundle identifier `com.resumedesigner.app`** — Tauri derives the
  app-data directory from it, so it is the on-disk address of every user's
  resumes. Changing it ships via the auto-updater and factory-resets the app.
  It is also the keychain `SERVICE` in `src-tauri/src/commands/secret.rs`, where
  the same argument applies to every stored API key.

  **iOS is `com.onpaper.app`, and that divergence is deliberate.** It is set by
  `identifier` in `src-tauri/tauri.ios.conf.json`, which Tauri 2 merges over
  `tauri.conf.json` for iOS builds. `project.yml`'s
  `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER` is INERT — the CLI overwrites it from the merged
  config on every build, so editing it alone silently does nothing.

  iOS had never shipped when this was chosen, so nothing was addressed by it yet
  and the brand name was still free — the same reasoning that named the CloudKit
  container `iCloud.com.onpaper.app`. Both are frozen from the first iOS release
  onward. Note that neither is reverse-DNS for a domain we own (`onpaper.com` is
  someone else's); that was a deliberate, informed choice — Apple treats these as
  opaque unique strings and verifies nothing. `secret.rs`'s `SERVICE` deliberately did
  NOT move: it is shared with desktop, where real users' keys sit behind it.
- **Every `resume-designer-*` / `resume-*` storage key** — desktop storage is
  one file per key, so these are filenames. Renaming them also turns the
  wipe-before-validate path in `persistence.js` into a silent data loss on the
  next backup import.
- **The legacy Electron key list and paths in `src-tauri/src/commands/migration.rs`**
  — historical facts about a shipped app's on-disk database, not configuration.
- **The `resume-designer/` directory and the GitHub repo slug** — the repo slug
  is compiled into the updater endpoints of every shipped binary.
- **`name = "resume-designer"` in `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`** — with no
  `bundle.mainBinaryName` set, the Cargo package name becomes
  `CFBundleExecutable` and the installed Windows `.exe` name. Only the `[lib]`
  name is branded (`on_paper_lib`).

Never sweep on the bare string `resume-`: it also names the `.resume-page` /
`.resume-sidebar` CSS classes that pagination and PDF page-splitting depend on.
Drive any key-related change off `BACKUP_FIXED_KEYS` in `src/profileKeys.js`.

### UI

- shadcn/ui here is the real thing: Tailwind Preflight is ON, components come from real shadcn primitives/source. Never hand-roll lookalike components from memory — copy or extend the actual primitives in `src/components/ui/`.

### Testing and verification

- The ClaudePreview browser is Chromium, but the shipped app runs in **WKWebView (WebKit)**. WebKit-only scroll/layout bugs will not reproduce in preview — write engine-agnostic fixes and verify in `npm run tauri:dev` for anything layout- or scroll-sensitive.
- PR CI builds run on macOS only. Type-check `#[cfg(windows)]` Rust code locally with `cargo check --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` (mingw toolchain is installed; the msvc target does not build on this machine).
